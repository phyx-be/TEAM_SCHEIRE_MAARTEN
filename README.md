# TEAM_SCHEIRE_MAARTEN

[Kurt Beheydt](https://twitter.com/kurtbeheydt) from [Sputnik Media](http://www.sputnikmedia.be/) contacted us in the search for some unique electronics that they could use for the opening credits of the new season of Team Scheire. In this tv show makers from all backgrounds try to find solutions for everyday issues. One of those makers is [Maarten Weyn](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/maarten-weyn/) who has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and teaches at the University of Antwerp. 

We based our design around a [Microchip ATSAMD11C14](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD11C14) which has native USB and is Arduino compatible with some hacks and the bootloader from [Mattairtech](https://github.com/mattairtech/ArduinoCore-samd). We added some [WS2812b LEDs](http://www.world-semi.com/) and the power supply circuit required for the basic functionality. For those that want some extra features, 3 push buttons can be stuffed on the back, converting the board in a small keyboard.
